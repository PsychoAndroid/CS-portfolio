   <h3 style="color:Purple;margin-left:15px">About Me</h3>
   <p>Alright,welcome to my page! It feels so good to make something like this, 
   it took time and effort to make this page, however I plan to make this even better in the future.
   Now lets get right to why I made this page. This page is for a school assignment showing how much I learned 
   in this class. So far I'm still trying to get used to it and this will take time and effort to remember how to make a website by heart.
   Another thing you should know about is,
   I wanted to learn about Computer Science because it seemed easy to learn and easy to teach to others. My intrest in technology can be traced back to
   eighth grade, My dad decided that I should get ahead in my tech class. Over the summer I started on the first few lessons in Technology. When the school year started I was already
   half way through the whole text book. Then I decided to use my skill to help my classmates who struggled. From my classmates thanking me for my skill I felt like I wanted to do more.
   So thats why I signed up for this class,I want to have my old experience of helping people and sharpen my coding skills. 
   Right now my website looks like something from 13 years ago, but I'm still trying to learn how to make it look like something from todays era.
   I take my father's word of "Practice means perfect" and no matter how many times I fail or make a mistake I will keep trying until I correct that mistake. 
   This page is just the begining of what I want to learn, my passion.

   <h5 style="color:Purple;margin-left:25px">My First Reaction to Learning HTML/CSS</h5>
   <p>My first reaction to HTML/CSS was confusion. I didn't know what I was doing then it grew on to me, for the basics I can remeber with ease.
   However, I still have the feeling of being confused and I always resort to the internet if I have any questions including easy questions. In the list
   of things I learned in HTML/CSS is everything I'm cabable of doing with no help. Another thing is everthing on that list is important for coding. I know
   it won't be the last time I see this commands. I'm gonna need them later on to improvise my website. Another thing is it will take me sometime
   to get the hang of this.</p>
