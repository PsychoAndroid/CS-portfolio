  <h1>How did I Make my Art Page</h1>
  <font size="5">
<h2 style="color:Blue;font-size:25px">Part 1:What did I Create?How does it Work Overall?</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size:15px">My painting tells a story about you, the user, being an artist who was
        hired by the people to decorate their colosseum. You begin to work when the moon rises and you
        continue to paint till moon sets. However, what does this painting say about me? Look at the moon, do you see that the color
        is blue. Now people connect the color of blue to someone being sad or depressed. However I choose the color blue because of one song that was
        listening to while I was creating this, that song was "Blue Moon". This song is hard to disect, but It gives off the feeling of being no longer alone.
        Giving the user the freedom to decorate to their hearts desire gives them the idea of being fulfilled, even if you don't feel it deep inside you feel complete and not alone.
        Anyways, my project works well overall, every peice of code works and are organized not to mentioned the comments explain what their purpose is and every peice of code serves a purposes
        and none of them are absent.</p>
        
<h3 style="color:Blue;font-size:25px">Part 2:What Code did I Used?</h3>
    
    <h4 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">1:Ellipse </h4>
         <p style="font-size:15px">This is just one of the many shapes that can be used in Javascript. Now to make a circle is simple, just type in <mark>ellipse((type in xPosition),( type in Yposition),(type in Length),(type in Width))</mark>
         as an addition you can add stroke,strokeweight, and fill if you want. Now you might ask yourself what is stroke,strokeweight, and fill? Well its really simple, stroke is the line that surrounds the circle and the colors can be changed. There are three positions in stroke<mark>(color)(moveTo)(lineTo)</mark> Strokeweight on the other hand
         can increase or decrease the thickness or width of the stroke. To type in a strokeweight all you have to do is type in<mark>strokeWeight()</mark>. Finnally is fill, the purpose of fill is to just fill in the circle give it any color just try it out. Type in <mark>Fill(*any #,any #,any #) to simply choose a color.</mark></p>
          <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/psychoandroid/programming/int2checkpoint/circle.html?_c9_id=livepreview1&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io">An example of Ellipse</a>
    
    <h5 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">2:If/Else</h5>
        <p style="font-size:15px">Now if and else statements are going to be used in A LOT in programming. If and else are conditionals meaning there meant to do specific actions so its basically true or false. For example, you ask a program to change the color of a cirlce if your mouse passes half way mark on the page. In my painting, it is used to change the moon to the other side.
         However, how does if/else statements work? Well its simple, type in <mark>if(*Type in condition in here*) and for 'else', type in else(*Type in condition in here*)</mark> as you can see their the same.</p>

    <br>
    <h6 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">3:For Loop</h6>
        <p style="font-size:15px">Oh hello For Loops! Nice to see you again on this fine day of the week! Now, for loops can be used for a lot of fun things like games,art, and of course websites. 
         In my painting they are used to make the dark night sky. How to make and use for loops are simple, type in <mark>for(*Input condition here*)</mark> and thats it. Pretty easy to make but kinda challenging to make what condition you want. Now some advice for loops, use it for backgrounds because you can make some cool stuff like a pattern of squares and circles. However, if you keep experimenting with loops it can end
         up like bright flashy lights on a screen in which I do not reccomended in any way.</p>

    <br>
    <h7 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">4:Functions</h7>
        <p style="font-size:15px">Hey you! Yeah you! Do you like "press E to interact button" or "Click left mouse to interact" in games and you want to apply it to litterly anything? Well you came to the right section my friend! Welcome to the world of function or the world of interaction as I say. Their purpose is to let the user interact with the page and are really fun to use.
         To create a function all you have to do is <mark>*variable name*=function(optional position)</mark> after that, you can do whatever you want! I also have to mention this command can be used to make animation and especially art. </p>

    <br>
    <h8 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">BONUS DUCKS! I mean 5:Comments</h8>
        <p style="font-size:15px"> Finnally, comments can be used to organized your program in which I highly recommend. Now you can't see its effect in the program, however its in the code. Its just handy to use to organized your program or website. Look back at my art page and look at the code to find comments I left there to organize myself. To create a comment its simple, just type <mark>//*ANYTHING YOU WANT*</mark></p>

 <h9 style="color:Blue;font-size:25px">Part 3:Choices,Things to Remember,Next Steps to Improve</h9>
 <br>
 <h10 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">Choices I made</h10>
 <p>The choices I made for my art page was simple desicions that I thought was necessary for the page. I honestly wanted, my artpage to be simple and explain feeling of creativity within the user. I remember one hard desicion 
 I had to make was the interaction of the user. I didn't know which function should I use, it was either mouse cliking or changint from night to day. Both are easy to acheive, but I felt like the circles will give the user more freedom to decorate the colosseum
 and decorate it to their hearts content.</p>
 <br>
 <h11 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px">Things to Remember </h11>
 <p>Javascript, one important programming language that is commonly used in games,websites, and I believe in different software. So remembering every single command can make my web page look presentable and shows my understanding of Javascript. You see all, some commands here like the ellipse aren't
 used as often, but loops,function,and conditionals are going to be common in anything that uses Javascript. You see without these commands different types of software won't be impressive or work at all. For loops are useful to creating creative backgrounds filled with colors, functions can be used to let the user interact or even make animations, and finally conditionals to make desicions in programming.
 Without these commands my artpage will look bland and not creative at all. Almost everything relies on Javascript from what I've seen and heard, so I have to keep every command in my head and use them in a later in time. </p>
 <br>
 <h12 style="color:Crimson;font-size:20px"> Next Steps to Improve</h12>
 <p>Next time I should push myself to make my projects look much better, I know that i'm still getting use to it and i'm still getting used the commands and their purpose they serve in websites. So next time, I should continue improving my websites and make them better throughout the years. I'll take everything I learn to make any of my projects better and any programming I take in the future I will remember every command to make it look 
    better and easier.</p>
